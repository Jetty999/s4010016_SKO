    </dl></p>
    <p>This was my introduction to coding with HTML and provided me with the information I required to begin this document.</p>

    <h2>Week 2 My introduction to Github:</h2>
    <p><dl>https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository<br>

        https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet</dl></p>
        <p>This was my introduction for creating a github repository and how to host a website using pages</p>

    <h2>Week 3 My introduction to P5.JS:</h2>
    <p><dl>https://p5js.org/tutorials/get-started/</dl></p>
        <P>The 'Minutes of code' videos was my introduction to coding in P5.JS and understanding its applications compared to HTML</P>
        <h4>After module learning</h4>
        <p><dl>https://p5js.org/tutorials/</dl></p>
        <p>After the module I was able to use these tutorials to learn much more of the fundamentals of P5.JS</p>
    
    <h2>Week 4 Learning various new formulas for P5.JS</h2>
    <p><dl>https://p5js.org/reference/<br>
        https://archive.p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Image/filter<br>
        https://archive.p5js.org/reference/#/p5/image</dl></p>
        <p>During this week I learned further into different formulas, variables and functions for P5.JS that can be incorperated into my final project</p>
        <h4>After module learning</h4>
        <p><dl>https://happycoding.io/tutorials/p5js/</dl></p>
        <p>After the module I was again able to go through this tutorial to further learn P5.JS</p>

    <h2>Week 5 & 6 Further learning P5.JS</h2>
    <p><dl>https://archive.p5js.org/learn/</dl></p>
    <p>Through the P5.JS website I spent lots of time reading about all the capabilities of P5.JS to know what was realistic for me to apply to my final project</p>
    <h4>After module learning</h4>
    <p><dl>https://p5js.org/education-resources/<br>
        https://p5js.org/reference/</dl></p>
    <p>After the module I was able to find even more educational resources to further learn P5.JS<br>
    I was also able to explore the reference page to look through various uses for different bits of code to further look into</p>

    <h2>Week 7 More functions for P5.JS and HTML</h2>
    <p>This week I learned how to add custom cursors, preload and load images and using buttons through the module</p>

    <h2>Week 8 Using sounds</h2>
    <p><dl>https://archive.p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.sound</dl></p>
    <p>This week I learned how to setup and import sound libraries, and load and play sounds</p>
    <h4>After module learning</h4>
