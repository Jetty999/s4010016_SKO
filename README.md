# Reflective Statement
Throughout this course, I learned a great deal about using code creatively to produce an art piece in the form of a website. Before, I mainly saw websites as practical tools for conveying information, however, this course opened my eyes to their potential as a canvas for artistic expression. This approach created an exciting contrast, transforming my perception of web design and allowing me to explore the artistic side of coding.

The assignments were engaging and provided opportunities to push my boundaries as an artist. Each task encouraged me to merge technical skills with creativity, challenging me to think outside traditional frameworks. I enjoyed experimenting and researching with different elements of code with each bit growing my final project. Despite these valuable experiences, I faced challenges throughout the course that impacted my performance, most notably my horrible time management and general life getting in the way of my studies. My struggle with time management led to some rushed work and limited time for experimentation, which I believe kept me from reaching my full potential in the projects.

When I first reviewed my final project, I was disappointed because the outcome didnâ€™t match my initial vision. I had ambitious ideas that I was eager to bring to life, but they ultimately proved more complex than anticipated, particularly for a beginner in coding. While it was frustrating to compromise my original concept, I soon realized that simplifying it was a necessary step. Trying to execute everything I had imagined would have been overwhelming and beyond my current skill level. Accepting this allowed me to appreciate the progress I made and focus on areas I could realistically improve.

In conclusion, this course has not only equipped me with foundational coding skills but also inspired me to view digital platforms in a new light. As I continue developing my coding abilities, I hope to build upon this understanding and refine my approach to integrating art and technology in future projects.
